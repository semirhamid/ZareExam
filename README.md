# ZareExam - Rapid Backend Development

Welcome to ZareExam! This project is a rapid backend development template tailored for building a .NET-based web application focusing on student and department management. With integrated authentication, validation, error handling, and logging features, it provides a solid foundation for quickly developing backend systems.

## Features

- **ASP.NET Core Web API**: Implements a RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD operations on students and departments, providing basic functionality for managing resources.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Integrates with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core for data access and modeling relationships between entities.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints, including endpoints for user registration, login, and token generation.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data integrity and security by implementing input validation for API requests, handling common validation scenarios such as required fields, data types, and length constraints.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Provides informative and consistent error responses for API requests, with centralized error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Getting Started
